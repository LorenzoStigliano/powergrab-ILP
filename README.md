#Introduction
The task for the Informatics Large Practical is to develop an autonomous (“smart”) component which isto play against a human component in a location-based strategy game.  The smart component is an au-tonomous drone which competes against a human player who is acting as the pilot of a remote-controlled(“dumb”) drone which moves only in response to directions from the pilot.
